As a full stack developer with over 3 years of experience, I found the innovative approach demonstrated in Splash Software's assignment both intriguing and practical. The concept of updating the multiplayer feature based on real-time data exchange is a testament to the creative and effective use of real-time synchronization principles. Completing this assignment took me about 14 hours, which I believe was a worthwhile investment to showcase my skills and understanding of the technology involved.

Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

**Real-Time Multiplayer Update:** The implementation of updating multiplayer based on time from the frontend to the backend is commendable. It showcases a solid understanding of real-time data synchronization principles.

**Error Handling Optimization:** While error handling is implemented, there is room for optimization. Considering the time constraints, refining error handling mechanisms could lead to a more robust application that gracefully handles unforeseen issues.

**Player Name as Unique Identifier:** Utilizing player names as unique identifiers for the prototype assignment is a pragmatic choice. However, it's essential to consider scalability and potential conflicts in a production environment.

**Reducing Rerenders:** The application could benefit from optimizing rerenders to improve performance. With more time, strategies such as memoization or component splitting could significantly reduce unnecessary rerenders.

**Responsiveness and Structure:** Given the assignment's focus, responsiveness and code structure were understandably deprioritized. However, a clearer separation of concerns and responsive design considerations could enhance the application's usability and maintainability.

**Frontend Design Decisions:** The decision to prioritize backend functionality over frontend design is understandable given time constraints. However, improving the grid/flex design and component length could enhance the user experience in future iterations.

**Charting Experience:** The lack of experience with charting libraries such as D3.js is understandable. Given more time, exploring and implementing suitable charting solutions would elevate the application's visual appeal and data representation capabilities.

Overall, the assignment demonstrates a strong foundation in real-time communication and backend logic. With further refinement in error handling, frontend design, and charting capabilities, the application has the potential to become a polished and impactful software solution.

I hope my insights and suggestions are considered, and I look forward to contributing to the continued improvement of this team.
If I don't receive an interview this time, I am committed to keep improving my skills and refining my approach until the next opportunity arises.
